      <h3>Heyyyyyy Uncle Father Oscar.</h3>
      <p>Don't leave your Uncle T-bag hanging. A trick is something a whore does for money… or cocaine. I could use a leather jacket for when I'm on my hog and have to go into a controlled slide. Happy. Taste the happy, Michael. Taste it. It tastes kind of like sad. These are my awards, Mother. From Army. The seal is for marksmanship, and the gorilla is for sand racing. You want to have some guy reach around you in the middle of the night, start messing with your junk? O-kay, who'd like a banger in the mouth? Yeah, like I'm going to spill coffee all over this $3,000 suit? Come on!</p>

      <h3>HUZZAH! Could it be love?</h3>
      <p>She's not 'that Mexican', Mom. She's my Mexican. And she's Colombian or something. Make love in your *own* hand, Mother! Chickens don't clap! If I wanted something your thumb touched, I'd eat the inside of your ear. This is the best free scrapbooking class I've ever taken! Let's see some bananas and nuts! Look at us, crying like a couple of girls on the last day of camp. I'll have a vodka rocks. (Mom, it's breakfast time.) And a piece of toast.</p>
